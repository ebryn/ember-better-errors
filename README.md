# ember-better-errors

Provides an error page when runtime errors occur in an Ember.js app.

To install, run `ember install ember-better-errors`.

It's quite common as you're developing a runtime error may occur and you won't notice because your dev tools console will not always be open. This addon will give an error page, similar to how Ember CLI gives you build errors, when an handled exception occurs in your app.

This addon is meant for development only, not for production use.
